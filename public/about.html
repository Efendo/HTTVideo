            The idea of HTTVideo originated from one of my other sites, MovingBricks.
            <br>
            The problem with MovingBricks was, i had to change the source code to upload a video.
            <br>
            I spent 2 days developing the basic site and systems.
            <br>
            First it was called "VidPlatform" during development, then it was called "PlayMotion".
            <br>
            Then i found out theres a company called PlayMotion, so i changed it to "HTTVideo".
            <br>
            The name HTTVideo comes from HTTP and video.
            <br>
            Now, after a while, its so much more!
